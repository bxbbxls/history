  "causes": "The Civil Rights Movement was spurred by centuries of racism and segregation in the United States.  This included the enslavement of millions of Africans, the disenfranchisement of African Americans after the Reconstruction era, the establishment of Jim Crow laws, and the pervasive discrimination and violence against African Americans in the South.  The Brown v. Board of Education Supreme Court decision in 1954, which declared segregation in public schools unconstitutional, fueled a sense of hope and urgency among African Americans.  Further, the murder of Emmett Till in 1955 highlighted the brutality faced by African Americans in the South, galvanizing the movement. ",
  "consequences": "The Civil Rights Movement had a profound impact on American society, leading to the passage of landmark legislation: The Civil Rights Act of 1964 banned discrimination on the basis of race, color, religion, sex or national origin in employment practices and public accommodations. The Voting Rights Act of 1965 aimed to overcome legal barriers to voting, especially in the South. The Civil Rights Act of 1968 outlawed discrimination in housing.  The movement's success brought about the end of legal segregation in the United States and led to greater political participation and representation for African Americans.  However, the movement also resulted in a backlash from white segregationists, including violence and resistance. ",
  "full_explanation": "The Civil Rights Movement, a significant period in American history, was a social movement and campaign that fought against racial segregation, discrimination, and disenfranchisement in the United States. It had its roots in the Reconstruction era following the Civil War and gained momentum in the 1940s. While its most visible activities took place in the 1960s, the movement's successes were a culmination of decades of grassroots organizing, legal battles, and direct action. The movement's history is intricately interwoven with the legacy of slavery and its aftermath.",
